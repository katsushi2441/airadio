# AI Radio Generator

AI Radio Generator is an automated AI project that generates
radio-style audio episodes and podcast-compatible RSS feeds
from news articles or keywords.

Users receive ready-to-publish audio files and RSS feeds
without manual recording, editing, or voice work.

---

## What this project does

AI Radio Generator provides a complete, automated workflow:

- Ingests news articles or keyword-based content
- Generates radio-style scripts using large language models (LLMs)
- Converts scripts into natural-sounding speech via text-to-speech
- Outputs audio files and updates podcast-compatible RSS feeds

All steps are executed automatically.

---

## Outputs (What users get)

- 🎧 Radio-style audio episodes (WAV / MP3)
- 📡 Podcast-compatible RSS feeds ready for distribution
- ⚙️ Fully automated pipeline with no manual recording or editing

These outputs can be directly published to podcast platforms
or used as AI-generated audio content.

---

## Who this project is for

- Content creators experimenting with automated audio generation
- Educators exploring spoken summaries and AI narration
- Developers interested in AI-powered media pipelines
- Independent media projects and research prototypes

---

## Example outputs

- ▶ Sample audio: https://exbridge.ddns.net/aidexx/tts/2243b1178ef34e2698a5037bd26ba1d9.wav
- ▶ Sample RSS feed: https://exbridge.jp/aidexx/rss.xml

## How it works

1. Ingests news articles via RSS feeds or keyword-based search
2. Generates radio-style scripts using an LLM
3. Converts scripts into speech using a TTS engine
4. Processes audio/text for publishing
5. Outputs audio files and updates podcast-compatible RSS feeds

---

## Key features

- Fully automated end-to-end AI pipeline
- News-to-audio conversion
- Modular architecture (script generation, TTS, publishing)
- Self-hosted and customizable
- Open-source and extensible

---

## Tech stack

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Podcast-compatible RSS generation
- Python and PHP-based automation scripts

---

## Voicebox (Text-to-Speech Control)

This project includes an optional Voicebox layer for controlling
the Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine via both UI and API.

- A lightweight web-based UI for manual testing and tuning
- A Python-based API server that wraps the VOICEVOX engine
- Designed to be reusable by AI Radio and other automation scripts

This separation allows flexible use:
manual testing via browser, or fully automated audio generation
from scripts.

## Background Music (BGM) Support

AI Radio Generator supports optional background music (BGM)
as part of its audio post-processing pipeline.

BGM allows generated radio narration to be mixed with
background music before publishing.

---

## BGM Program Overview

Background music handling is implemented as a first-class feature.

Related components:

- src/bgm_manager.php  
  Manages background music files, including upload,
  selection, and configuration for mixing.

- src/ttsfile.php  
  Manages generated TTS audio files and prepares them
  for further audio processing.

- src/tts2blog.py  
  Performs post-processing of generated audio.
  When BGM is enabled, this program mixes the main
  radio narration audio with background music using ffmpeg.

---

## BGM Files

Directory:
bgm/

Description:
- Stores background music audio files provided by the user
- Files are manually uploaded or managed via bgm_manager.php
- These files are not auto-generated by the system

Supported formats:
- mp3
- wav
- m4a

---

## Mixed Audio Output

Directory:
mixed/

Description:
- Stores final mixed audio files
- Output includes radio narration combined with BGM
- Files are generated automatically during post-processing
- Resulting audio is suitable for playback, download,
  or publishing to podcast platforms

---

## Extensibility

The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy
to extend or customize individual components such as script generation,
text-to-speech, background music processing, or publishing workflows
for different use cases.

## 🎬 Audio → MP4 Video Generation (Image + Radio)

AI Radio Generator includes an optional feature to convert
generated radio audio (mp3 / wav) into **MP4 video files**
by combining the audio with a single static image.

This feature is designed for:
- YouTube uploads
- YouTube Shorts
- Spotify Video Podcast
- Other video-based distribution platforms

---

## Video Generation Architecture

The video generation pipeline is intentionally separated
from the main PHP application.

- **PHP Server**
  - Provides a Web UI for:
    - Image upload
    - Audio file URL input
  - Does **not** execute ffmpeg

- **Python API Server (FastAPI)**
  - Executes ffmpeg
  - Generates MP4 files from audio + image
  - Returns a public URL for the generated video

This separation keeps the PHP server lightweight and secure,
while allowing full control over media processing on the
Python side.

---

## Web Usage (MP4 Generation)

1. Open `audio2mp4.php`
2. Upload an image file (PNG / JPG)
3. Enter a generated audio file URL (mp3 / wav)
   - Example:
     ```
     https://exbridge.ddns.net/aidexx/mixed/xxxxxxxx.mp3
     ```
4. Click **Generate MP4**
5. The generated video is immediately playable and downloadable

---

## API: Audio to MP4

### POST `/audio_to_mp4`

**Request (multipart/form-data)**

- `image`  
  Static image file (PNG / JPG)

- `audio_url`  
  URL of the audio file (mp3 / wav)

**Response Example**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "file": "xxxxxxxx.mp4",
  "mp4_url": "https://exbridge.ddns.net/aidexx/video_mp4/xxxxxxxx.mp4"
}
